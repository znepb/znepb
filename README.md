## Hello, welcome to my GitHub.
I'm Marcus, a self-proclaimed programming, computers, and roller coaster nerd. I've been programming since 2017 (almost 10 years now). My favorite programming languages are Kotlin and TypeScript. If you'd like to get to know more about me, check out [my website](https://znepb.me), or send me a friend request on Discord (@znepb). I am currently studying to earn a Bachleor's in Computer Science.
